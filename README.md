I'm a Software Engineer apprentice at Elsevier training with Makers. I have previously completed a 6 week coding bootcamp with Generation UK and WhiteHat GB and am now on a 12 week Makers bootcamp. Lately, I've been building Vanilla JS and Ruby projects, learning how to build a fully interactive web-application. I am planning to learn React next. 

📔 My most recent project is this [Task Planner](https://vinc3108.github.io/Final_Project_Task_Planner/) made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

⭐️ You can also find my work on my [Portfolio Website](https://vincenzoflorio.co.uk/) which I built as my first project following the bootcamp.
